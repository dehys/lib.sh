**Lib.sh is a collection of scripts made for automating different aspects to make development life easier for software engineers.**

Made using shellscript (hence the name) with different functionalities. You can pick and choose what script(s) you want to use or get the installer which will just correctly install the script for you and all it's prerequisites. Read below for more specific descriptions of each script.

**NOTE:** All script's may <u>not</u> work with all terminal emulations. See tested versions in specific README file.

### Getting started

It is recommended to use the installer for installing the scripts as most of them depend on other files and correct paths to those files. If you insist, you can place the dependent files of the script in ~/.libsh/ and cross your fingers that it works.
Here is a guide on how to use the installer:

1. Clone the repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/dehys/lib.sh.git
    ```
   <br />
2. Change directory with **cd lib.sh/** and start the installer<br>
   **NOTE:** Make sure the the *installer.sh* file is set as an executable file.
    ```shell
    cd lib.sh/
    ./installer.sh
    ```
   <br />
3. Select what scripts you want to install with your arrow keys
